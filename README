## Convolutional Neural Network for 3D Models

The purpose of this project was to build a neural network capable classifying LIDAR point clouds in realtime. The convolutional neural network implemented in this project is capable of classifying 3D binary matrixes, with the extended ability to classify 3D meshes through a voxelization preprocessor. Unlike computer vision solutions for classifying objects, this approach is capable of classifying objects with full volumetric context in realtime.

# Background

The 3D model convolutional neural network is based on the same concepts used in image classifying convolutional neural networks adpated to 3D inputs. This was implemented with 3D convolutional and max pooling layers included in the [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) library.
